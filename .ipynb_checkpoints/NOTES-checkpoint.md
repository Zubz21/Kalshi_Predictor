## To DO List

* Read in new data to make it current
* Graph the trend of gap between open and close/high and low over time to capture trends
* Graph the above trend on specific days of the week
* We need to build a few model
    * Accurately predict the close within a range of +- 50 on the data we already have
        * Graph the above model to understand how far of the actual close was our prediction
        * Graph the comparison between the actual open vs the actual close and the predicted close and actual open
        * If we understand how far off our predictions are that can be our range going into december since things are much slower
    * Predict within what range a target value will be in regardless of right or wrong, based off a mdoel what is the variance of the distribution
    * Predict based off curent event contract prices whether or not we should make a bid on a specific bracket
        * We need to pull in not only the event data for the stock but actual live data for the stock as well
   
* We need to understand the realtionship between volume and high/low prices to see if volume dictates direction and at what magnitude
* Build an app or dashboard where I can monitor this and get alerts for it as well
