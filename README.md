# Kalshi_Predictor
Kalshi has a market on their platform where you can predict where the NASDAQ 100 will close for that day within a range. The options are provided for options in incremenets of 100 point spread for example "14100-14200", "14200-14300","14300-14400", etc
What we are trying to do is use a dataset of NASDAQ daily performance to help our decision making into where we should make investments for that day and at times even days in advance or specifically for the end of the week. Of course similar to normal option markets the price of a contract does fluctaue throughout the day deending on how the markets are trading that day which is a factor we are also taking into consideration. The following documents are the main Jupyter Notebook where we do the data cleaning, exploration, and modeling. In addition we also have all the correlating datasets.
